# dysonsphere-savefile-parser

This code will decode parts of the Dyson Sphere Program savefile format.  It is based on
an older savefile format, and likely needs to be updated for a more modern file format.

It's here as an example, and perhaps a starting point for others.  If you want to make changes,
submit a PR, but I will admit I consider this code to be sleeping.
